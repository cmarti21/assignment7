		<h2>Camp Nou Stadium</h2>

		<p>Even if you're not a fútbol (soccer) fan, Camp Nou is worth a visit to experience the pride Catalans have for the FC Barcelona team. Able to hold nearly 100,000 screaming fans, which can be quite intimidating for visiting teams, Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe. The on-site museum showcases trophies and awards the team has garnered through the years. Interesting and interactive displays invite visitors to learn a little more about the fútbol culture and its impact on the city.  For example, Catalans rallied behind the motto "més que un club" (more than a club) during the oppressive Francisco Franco regime, becoming a symbol of striving for independence. The slogan is even spelled out in giant gold letters among the royal and ruby stadium seats. Depending on which team they're playing, tickets to a game can be expensive (especially for El Classico). However, visitors note that seeing the dedicated fans and watching some of the best soccer players in the world in action is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. </p>

		<h2>Museu Picasso (Picasso Museum)</h2>

		<p>When you feel like you've hit your Gaudí limit, head to the Picasso Museum (Museu Picasso) for a change of pace. While most people know Pablo Picasso for his distorted portraits, this museum displays his work on a timeline of sorts, allowing you to follow his progression from the more controlled works of his early years to the very whimsical paintings and sculptures from the end of his career. Make sure you dedicate plenty of time to Picasso: the museum itself holds several thousand pieces by him, including works from his famous Blue Period. The museum also explores the artist's lifelong relationship with Barcelona, explaining why he chose the city for his museum before he died.</p>

		<h2>La Barceloneta Beach</h2>
		<img src="images/playa.jpg" alt="barcelona beach">
		<p>In between all the cultural and artistic attractions Barcelona has up its sleeves, it's easy to forget that the city is situated right along the brilliantly blue waters of the Mediterranean. The city's largest stretch of sand is broken up into two beaches; La Barceloneta and Platja de la Nova Icària. Both are separated by the Port Olímpic harbor, easily recognized by the two seafront skyscrapers and giant golden fish sculpture, El Peix. La Barceloneta is the more visited of the two, known for its lively atmosphere on both the sand (vendors walk around selling everything from mojitos to on-the-spot massages) and the beachfront promenade (there are cafes and bars situated on the beach throughout). The beach features loads of amenities on-site including bathrooms, showers, changing rooms, umbrellas, lounge chairs, sports courts such as volleyball and beach tennis and more. </p>
